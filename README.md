# Twitter4T

Built with [Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html), make sure to reference the library before you're trying to build it.

Fill in twitter4j_example.properties, rename it to twitter4j.properties and build!

## Twitter Authentication

The Authentication is made via OAuth, if you authenticate, the token and token secret will be stored in twitter4j.properties so make sure you're not accidentially pushing this file to GitHub.
